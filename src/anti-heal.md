## TL;DR

There are only 4 significant anti-heal items, so take the correct one per the
role you are playing:

| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---- |
| Mage         | Morellonomicon         | [<img src="/images/items/Morellonomicon.webp" width="60">](/images/items/Morellonomicon.webp) |

| Bruiser      | Chempunk Chainsword    | [<img src="/images/items/Chempunk_Chainsword.webp" width="60">](/images/items/Chempunk_Chainsword.webp) |
| Tank         | Thornmail              | [<img src="/images/items/Thornmail.webp" width="60">](/images/items/Thornmail.webp) |


### Tell me More

The items above reduce the enemy's heal by 50% for 3 seconds when dealing damage to them, except Thornmail, which triggers when you receive damage. The effect is called Grievous Wounds and can be acquired by buying the tier 2 item alone in the associated item build path. This can be useful as a cheap solution against foes with healing abilities, leaving the full item to be built later.


**Ability-Based Anti-Heals**: Varus has an ability that can disrupt enemies' healing abilities.
This skill, called "Hail of Arrows," reduces the enemy's heal by 40% for 3 seconds.
It also slows and deals 70/115/160/205 Physical Damage to the enemy.


**Spell-Based Anti-Heals**: The only spell that can reduce enemy heals is
"Ignite," which deals True Damage and reduces heals by 60%. This spell has
a range of 625 and lasts for 5 seconds, dealing 72-380 True Damage to
the enemy.
