## TL;DR

There are only 4 significant anti-heal items, so take the correct one per the
role you are playing:

| Role         | Item                   | Icon                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| AD           | Mortal Reminder        | <img src="/images/items/Mortal_Reminder.webp" width="60">     |

### Tell me More

The items above reduce the enemy's heal by 50% for 3 seconds when dealing
damage to them, except Thornmail, which triggers when you receive damage. The
effect is called Grievous Wounds and can be acquired by buying the tier 2 item
alone in the associated item build path. This can be useful as a cheap solution
against foes with healing abilities, leaving the full item to be built later.


**Ability-Based Anti-Heals**: Varus has an ability that can disrupt enemies'
healing abilities. This skill, called "Hail of Arrows," reduces the enemy's
heal by 40% for 3 seconds. It also slows and deals 70/115/160/205 Physical
Damage to the enemy.


**Spell-Based Anti-Heals**: The only spell that can reduce enemy heals is
"Ignite," which deals True Damage and reduces heals by 60%. This spell has
a range of 625 and lasts for 5 seconds, dealing 72-380 True Damage to
the enemy.
