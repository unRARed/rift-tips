Don't lose the game before it begins. Not being up against the following
Champions will help.

### Tristana

Tristana can wreck a lane if left unchecked. She does a ton of damage and 
builds crit. Her bombs work on Turrets. With her jump, she can be on you in
an instant and just as quickly escape out of your range. Play her or ban her.

### Pyke

He'll pull you, stun you, execute you and then reclaim half his health. Feed
him and he'll be 1v5ing your entire team. Ban him.

### Yummi

At lower Tiers, Yummi feels more like a liability to the team she's on, but
as overall play improves (due to your ranking up), she becomes a cheat code.
Best ban her.

### More Banning Considerations

| Champion     | Why?                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Blitzcrank   | A lot of players seem to struggle dodging his rocket grab.  |
| Kayn         | Flies around the map like a boss; ganks you shortly after.  |
| Kayle        | If she scales, you will lose.                               |
| Teemo        | If you don't end up feeding him, someone else will.         |
| Twitch       | He appears suddenly and kills you when you're vulnerable.   |
